3 Clients accessing the shared memory and update the temp variable one by one which is located in shared memory.

Shared memory access is restricted by semaphores. 

NOTE: shmat() is not working because we didn't call the shmget(). 
we just pass the shmid through execl to all clients. But its not working.

::::::NOTE::::::

ITS WORKING. JUST REMOVE THE SHMDT() AND SHMCTL(). BECAUSE DUE TO THIS, MAIN PROCESS DELETE THE LINK NODE + DELTE THE WHOLE SHARED MEMORY.
SO, NO NEED TO CREATE THE SHARED MEMORY AGAIN IN ALL CLIENTS.
